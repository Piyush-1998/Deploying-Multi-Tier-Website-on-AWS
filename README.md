# Deploying-Multi-Tier-Website-on-AWS

Hello Everyone!!! Welcome to this project on deploying a full-stack application on

AWS and the application would mimic the functionality of something like Streaming

application. So our focus would be to basically see how an application can be

deployed on an architecture or cloud like AWS so we will not be getting into

coding instead we would be discussing if we have an application

at hand and if we have defined some features that we want how to enable

those features using a cloud infrastructure like AWS.

Below is the list of AWS Services which we have used :-

➡ Application Load Balancers

➡ Amazon Machine Images

➡ EC2 Instances

➡ Elastic Block Storage

➡ Internet Gateway

➡ Key Pair

➡ Network ACLs

➡ Network Interfaces

➡ Route 53

➡ Route Tables

➡ Security Groups

➡ Snapshots

➡ Subnets

➡ Target Groups

➡ VPC
